    <img src="ru.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="History Image">
    <p>
        RUPP has a rich history that reflects the socio-political changes in Cambodia. Initially founded as a response to the need for higher education, the university has undergone significant transformations since its inception. During the Khmer Rouge regime, the university faced closure, and many intellectuals were persecuted. However, after the fall of the regime, RUPP was reestablished in 1993 and has since played a pivotal role in rebuilding the country's educational landscape. The university has expanded its programs and facilities, adapting to the evolving needs of society. Today, RUPP is recognized as a leading institution in Cambodia, contributing to the development of human resources and providing a platform for academic collaboration both nationally and internationally. The university's resilience and commitment to education continue to inspire generations of students. As it moves forward, RUPP remains dedicated to enhancing its academic offerings and fostering a spirit of inquiry and innovation among its students.
